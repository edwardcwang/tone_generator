Simple tone generator with dynamically controllable frequency in Python.

Run `source sourceme.sh` to run the demo and add wavebender to the `PYTHONPATH`.

Use this for projects where you need to play tones where the frequency needs to be dynamically varied - e.g. by user input.

Uses PyAudio and the https://github.com/zacharydenton/wavebender library.
